Stuff that is still TODO:

Deep Learning Model:
- FIX POLICY NW EVALUATION
- Combination both models
- hooks
- Have more metrics for evaluation

Environment:
- Matrix kind of sucks
- Speed up??
- don't disregard seen states when doing tree search - DONE (maybe not efficient)
- Find a way to remove those stupid loops
- When multiple moves lead to the solution take that into account for training the policy network

Configs:
- find useful configs, mostly done

Overall:
- Documentation
- Less calls of functions that only call other functions

Buffer:
- write size and max size to tensorboard

Optimizer:
- Have a global step

TreeSearch:
- DFS
- BFS
- Beam Search?
- Combination of DFS and BFS

Evaluation:
- Have perfect solutions to test on periodically to measure improvement:
    - measure: steps to optimality, time, visited nodes
- Evaluate the Variance of the value function of all permutations -> should be as small as possible
