Stuff that is still TODO:

Deep Learning Model:
- Change Architecture
- Policy Function
- Combination both models
- hooks

Environment:
- Matrix kind of sucks
- Speed up??
- don't disregard seen states when doing tree search

Configs:
- find usefull configs
- implement function to load configs and pass to the model

Overall:
- Documentation
- Less calls of functions that only call other functions

TreeSearch:
- DFS
- BFS
- Beam Search?
- Combination of DFS and BFS
