Stuff that is still TODO:

Deep Learning Model:
- Change Architecture
- Policy Function
- Combination both models
- hooks

Environment:
- Matrix kind of sucks
- Speed up??
- actually end the function if a solution is found, terminate
- don't disregard seen states when doing tree search - DONE (maybe not efficient)

Configs:
- find useful configs
- implement function to load configs and pass to the model

Overall:
- Documentation
- Less calls of functions that only call other functions

TreeSearch:
- DFS
- BFS
- Beam Search?
- Combination of DFS and BFS

Evaluation:
- Have perfect solutions to test on periodically to measure improvement:
    - measure: steps to optimality, time, visited nodes
